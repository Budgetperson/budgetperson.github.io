Summer vacation has begun! From now until my internship at HomeAway begins I will be:

1. Fixing some minor health issues.

2. Working through [Interview Cake](http://www.interviewcake.com).

3. Practicing and playing basketball, using EGT 2 by Drew Hanlen.

4. Getting stronger using [StrongLifts](http://www.stronglifts.com).

5. Reading and Listening
	* Current Book: The Sports Gene by David Epstein. 
	* Current Podcasts: The Tim Ferriss Show, Dunc'd On Basketball Podcast, The Lowe Post, and the Pure Sweat Basketball Show

6. (miscellaneous) meditating daily, upgrading my wardrobe, and writing more

Ordered by priority, since there's not enough time to do everything.
