Currently, I have a internship at HomeAway, so I'm working most of the time. Other things I'm doing:

1. Fixing some minor health issues.

2. Experimenting with my diet.

3. Practicing basketball, but not as much as I'd like to.

4. Getting stronger using [StrongLifts](http://www.stronglifts.com).

5. Reading and Listening
	* Current Book: Just finished _The Obstacle is the Way_ by Ryan Holiday.
	* Current Podcasts: The Tim Ferriss Show, Dunc'd On Basketball Podcast, The Lowe Post, and the Pure Sweat Basketball Show

6. Upgrading my wardrobe.
